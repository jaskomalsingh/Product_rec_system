Overview

To develop the personalized product recommendation system we used python scripts and utilized libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, and Scikit-learn for feature extraction and similarity computation. The main functionalities included in this interface are data loading, preprocessing, and generating recommendations.

The implemented recommendation system successfully loads and processes data, prompts users for their names, and provides personalized product recommendations. Users can input their names, and the system suggests products based on their preferences and purchase history, resulting in more diverse and user-specific recommendations.
